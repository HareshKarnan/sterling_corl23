### Training representations using STERLING

To launch the training script for STERLING:

```python train.py --data_config_path spot_data/test.yaml```

Note : The code release only contains the training script for STERLING. The ROS node to process rosbags from the spot for the offline pre-processing step will be released shortly!.
